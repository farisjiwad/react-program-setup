Notes for Dev:
**If this program is using IW, need to set up the connection string.
**Stats Service and Result Shredder are turned on as part of the program setup.
** For Certiport BOX programs:
- Enable Webhooks service
- Set PW-<db> Programs.Options = 1
- Add the following to PW-Master.ApplicationProperties:
ApplicationID = 7, ProgramID = <ProgramID>, Value = /SFTP - Log Files (Certiport)/<Programs.VendorProgramID>
- Enable Services: VUEResultConfirmationServices, ResultUpload, ResultShredder, IW Webhooks
- On STAGING only, configure VUEResultConfirmationService to point to VUE's CTT environment
USE[PW-Master]
GO
SELECT *
FROM ApplicationProperties
WHERE ApplicationID = 183
AND [Key] = 'CTTProgramIDs'

** Add MonitorPrograms record for all IW monitors for the new program.
** Reminder for when we create new databases:
- Ekta: Update SQL Farms to have new database show up
- Shani/Lindsay: Verify SQL Farms config
To turn on the result shredder, run this in the program database:
DECLARE @RC int
DECLARE @programID bigint
EXECUTE @RC = [dbo].[its_ConfigureResultShredder_2_0_Service]
@programID = <PROGRAM ID>
GO
